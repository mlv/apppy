##Apppy -- App.net Python library

An endpoint-complete app.net library. 

##To use

You can use an already-existing access token, or use your client id / secret to get one.

```python
from apppy import *

api = apppy(access_token="...", app_access_token="...")

r=api.getUser("me")
assert r.json()['data']['username'] == username
```

It was tested with requests 1.1.0, but other versions should also work. Each endpoint call generates the 
appropriate URL, moves known API parameters to the appropriate location, then calls the corresponding requests 
call. It returns the request response.

It automatically handles rate limit requests by sleeping and retrying. If you don't want that, and know what 
you're doing, the following code:
```
api.gimme_429 = True
```
will let you catch 429 (rate limit) errors. 

Apppy.py is machine generated. It uses [@Duerig's endpoints.json library](https://github.com/duerig/appnet.js/blob/master/hbs/endpoints.json) to generate all the endpoints. The code that generates the endpoints is not part 
of this distribution, so while I will work hard to fix any problems, I won't accept pull requests against 
apppy.py (but I will use them to correct the source files that generate apppy.py). But please submit issues if you have them.
