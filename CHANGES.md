Version 1.2

Broadcast channel changes: New endpoints:

    getUnreadBroadcastCountChannel()
    markBroadcastChannelsReadChannel()
    deactivateChannel()

Broadcast channels act just like regular channels, except they broadcast 
to the app.net mobile app. 

Also, it's now possible to deactivate (make it hard to find, permanently 
block all new messages, etc) a channel.

=======================
Added user streams. They can be used like 
```
st=api.createUserStream(timeout=600)
u=api.getUnifiedStreamPost(connection_id=st.headers['Connection-Id'])
for line in st.iter_lines(chunk_size=1):
    if line:
        blob = json.loads(line)
        print (json.dumps(blob, sort_keys=True, indent=2))
```

See the [app.net documentation](http://developers.app.net/docs/resources/user-stream/#available-endpoints) for which endpoints can be used in place of getUnifiedStreamPost()

Also included are two new endpoints, destroyUserStream() and destroySubscriptionUserStream(). 
First takes a connection_id, and second takes a connection_id and a subscription_id.

Because of the addition of user streams, the app stream endpoints have been changed from, eg. api.getAllStream()
to api.getAllAppStream() (s/Stream/AppStream/)
